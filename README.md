## PantryChef: The App

PantryChef is an open-source Android app that allows users to scan food items and retreive a list of recipes that leverage only the ingredients in their possession.

Please see the [issues list](https://github.com/brandonschabell/PantryChef/issues) for an up-to-date list of work that needs to be done. Feel free to comment on any issues with opinions or if you'd like to work on the issue.

*PantryChef is still in its infancy, so this readme will be updated as progress is made.*
