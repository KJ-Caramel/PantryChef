## PantryChef: The App

PantryChef is an open-source Android app that allows users to scan food items and retreive a list of recipes that leverage only the ingredients in their possession.

Please see the [issues list](https://github.com/brandonschabell/PantryChef/issues) for an up-to-date list of work that needs to be done. Feel free to comment on any issues with opinions or if you'd like to work on the issue.

## Rules/Workflow/Formatting:
* All commits should be made on forked branches.
* Branch names should be formatted with the issue number and a brief description of the issue. (e.g. ISSUE-184-create-rest-path-for-api-callback.)
* Commit messages should also start with an issue number. (e.g. "ISSUE-184 created switch statement for api identification".)
* Pull requests should be made to the "dev" branch. The master branch represents the production version.
* **Tabs, not spaces!**

*PantryChef is still in its infancy, so this readme will be updated as progress is made.*
