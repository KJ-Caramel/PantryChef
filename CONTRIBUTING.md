# Introduction

### Thank you for considering contributing to PantryChef!

The following guidelines have been setup in order to minimize the time spent fixing code to match formatting preferences and to maximize the time you spend writing amazing code!

### What can you do for PantryChef?

We have so much for you to do! If you want to do something as simple as cleaning up documentation or as complicated as taking a major development task from the issue list, we have something for you! You should also feel free to add bugs or improvements to the issue list, or comment on existing issues if you have anything at all to say about them.

# Ground Rules
### Be kind!
We welcome developers with varying levels of experience. We encourage questions and hope that you feel comfortable enough to push yourself into working on this app regardless of your experience or expertise. That being said, if you are a more experienced developer, please take the time to help those who have questions. If you see a pull request with code that is unfit for a merge, give constructive criticism! I'd much rather receive 100 "bad" pull requests and help a developer grow than receive no pull requests at all. For more information on our community expectations, please see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PantryChef/PantryChef/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution
### How should I start?
You've picked an issue, you understand what needs to be done, you're ready to code!

The first thing you'll need to do is leave a comment on the issue to let others know you plan on working on it. Others are still free to work on the issue if they'd like, but they'll at least know there's someone else out there that may get a pull request in first.

Next, you'll need to fork the _dev_ branch to create a new branch with an appropriate name. We ask that you follow the following branch naming convention:

  ISSUE-< _ISSUE #_ >-< _BRIEF-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME_ >
  
Examples include: "ISSUE-187-Add-Recipe-Delete-Tool" or "ISSUE-47-Pantry-Deletion-Bugfix"
  
### What do I do when I'm done?
You should make sure that new tests have been written to cover the feature you're working on. We recommend that you take a test-driven approach to your code- write your tests first, then write code to make your tests pass. This is especially effective for bug fixes. Regardless of the approach you take, please make sure all tests are passing before you send in a pull request. When tests are green, you're ready to make your pull request to the _dev_ branch. This is a great time to double check that your pull request contains your issue number. As soon as you issue your pull request, comment on the issue to let us know! We wouldn't want other people wasting their time working on the same issue after you're done.

# Code formatting
### Tabs or spaces?
Tabs.

### Anything else?
Of course! We follow "Google Style", which can be found [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). There are only 2 differences we observe:
* We, of course, use tabs over spaces.
* Linewraps should occur after 120 characters (Google Style uses 100.)

# Final words
